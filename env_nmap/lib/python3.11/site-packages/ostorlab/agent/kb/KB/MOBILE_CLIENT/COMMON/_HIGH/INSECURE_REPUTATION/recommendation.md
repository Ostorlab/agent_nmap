If you discover that one of the domain names/IP addresses associated with your application has a bad reputation or is flagged as malicious, it's important to take action to address the issue and ensure the security and reliability of your application.
Actions you need to take will depend on the nature of the asset, your control over it, and the severity of the reputation issue.
Here are some recommendations on what to do in such a situation:

 * Determine why the asset has a bad reputation score. It could be due to various factors, such as hosting malicious content, spam, or being associated with a history of cyberattacks. Investigate the specifics of the problem.

 * Ensure that the reputation score is accurate and up-to-date. Sometimes, these scores can change over time due to legitimate reasons. Verify the source of the reputation score and try to understand the reasons behind it.

 * Consider isolating it from your primary systems. You may want to temporarily disable or quarantine the asset to prevent further potential issues while you investigate.

 * If the asset is associated with a service you control, take steps to patch and secure it. This might involve updating software, implementing stronger security measures, and ensuring it is not used for malicious purposes.
