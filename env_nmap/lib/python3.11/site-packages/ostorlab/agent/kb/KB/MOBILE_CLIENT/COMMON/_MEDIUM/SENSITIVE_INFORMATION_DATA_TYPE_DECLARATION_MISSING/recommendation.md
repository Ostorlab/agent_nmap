To mitigate the vulnerability of checks if the sensitive information data type declaration matches usage, developers should regularly review and update the data type declarations to ensure they accurately reflect how the sensitive information is being used in the code. Additionally, implementing strict access controls and encryption techniques can help protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or misuse. Regular security audits and testing can also help identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the code.
