The application calls the registerReceiver method with the argument flags set to `RECEIVER_EXPORTED`, which can be exploitable as it exposes the BroadcastReceiver to external applications, potentially leading to unauthorized access and other security vulnerabilities.

=== "Java"
   ```java
   context.registerReceiver(broadcastReceiver, intentFilter, RECEIVER_EXPORTED);
   ```
