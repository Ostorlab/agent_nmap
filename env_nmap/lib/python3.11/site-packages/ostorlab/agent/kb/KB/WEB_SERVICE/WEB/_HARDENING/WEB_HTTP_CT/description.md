The Content-Type header is missing, which means that this website could risk a MIME-sniffing attack.

MIME-type sniffing is standard functionality in browsers to find an appropriate way to render data where the HTTP
headers sent by the server are either inconclusive or missing.

This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially
causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the intended one.

The problem arises once a website allows users to upload content published on the web server. If an attacker can carry
out an XSS (Cross-site Scripting) attack by manipulating the content in a way to be accepted by the web
application and rendered as HTML by the browser, it is possible to inject code in e.g., an image file, and make the
victim
execute it by viewing the image.
