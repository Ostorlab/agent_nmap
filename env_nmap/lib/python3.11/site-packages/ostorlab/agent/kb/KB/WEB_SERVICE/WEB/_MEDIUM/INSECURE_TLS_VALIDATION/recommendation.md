To mitigate the risk of insecure TLS certificate validation, it is recommended that the application implements secure certificate validation mechanisms on both the client and the server. This includes:

- Checking the validity of the server's certificate to ensure that it has not expired, has not been revoked, and is issued by a trusted certificate authority.
- Configuring the hostname verification to ensure the certificate matches the server's domain name to prevent accepting certificates with invalid hostnames.
- Using trusted certificate authorities and avoiding self-signed certificates or untrusted root certificates.

Additionally, it is important to keep the application and any libraries or frameworks used up-to-date with the latest security patches and to regularly test the application's security posture to identify any vulnerabilities that may exist.
