To ensure you don't have insecure header settings, consider the following:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**

Enforce restrictions on content sources, mitigating risks associated with cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and unauthorized resource loading.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com;
```

2. **Cookie Security Headers:**

Implement Secure and HttpOnly flags to prevent cookie theft and manipulation, enhancing user session security.

```http
Set-Cookie: sessionid=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly;
```

3. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**

Properly configure CORS policies to restrict resource access from different origins, mitigating cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-origin data leakage.

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
```

4. **HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP):**

Utilize HPKP to bind public keys to specific web servers, protecting against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks involving fraudulent certificates.

```http
Public-Key-Pins: pin-sha256="base64=="; max-age=5184000; includeSubDomains;
```

5. **Redirection Headers:**

Ensure secure redirection by implementing strict controls to prevent open redirection vulnerabilities, thereby safeguarding users against phishing attacks.

```http
Location: https://example.com/secure-page
```

6. **Referrer Policy:**

Set appropriate referrer policies to control how much information is passed in the Referer header, reducing the risk of sensitive data exposure.

```http
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

7. **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**

Implement SRI to verify the integrity of external resources, such as scripts and stylesheets, guarding against unauthorized modifications and supply chain attacks.

```html
<script src="https://example.com/example.js" integrity="sha256-base64==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

8. **X-Content-Type-Options:**

Enable the 'nosniff' directive to prevent browsers from MIME-sniffing a response, mitigating risks associated with content type confusion attacks.

```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

9. **X-Frame-Options:**

Set X-Frame-Options to restrict embedding of web content into frames, protecting against clickjacking attacks and ensuring the integrity of our web pages.

```http
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

10. **X-XSS-Protection:**
 
Enable XSS protection mechanisms to mitigate XSS attacks by instructing browsers to sanitize or block potentially malicious scripts.

```http
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```
