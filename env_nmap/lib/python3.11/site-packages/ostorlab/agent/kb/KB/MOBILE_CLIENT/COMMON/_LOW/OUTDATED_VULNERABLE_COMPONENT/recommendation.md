To mitigate the risks associated with vulnerable components, consider the steps below:

1. Identify the vulnerable component: Begin by identifying the specific vulnerable component being used in your application. This could be a library, framework, language feature, or any other software component.
2. Update the vulnerable component to the latest version.
3. If the vulnerable component is deprecated, consider using an alternative component or fork.
