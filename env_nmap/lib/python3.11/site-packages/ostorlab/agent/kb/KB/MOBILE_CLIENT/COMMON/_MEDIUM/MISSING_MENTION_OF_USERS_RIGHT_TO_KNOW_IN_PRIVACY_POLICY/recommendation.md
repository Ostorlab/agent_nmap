To mitigate the vulnerability of not mentioning users' right to know about information sharing in your privacy policy, it is important to update the policy to clearly outline how and when users will be informed about any sharing of their information. This can include providing regular updates on data sharing practices, obtaining explicit consent from users before sharing their information, and offering transparency on the types of information that may be shared with third parties. Additionally, implementing robust data protection measures and ensuring compliance with relevant privacy regulations can help build trust with users and protect their privacy rights.
