To mitigate the vulnerability of not having a clear description of data retention practices in your privacy policy, ensure that you clearly outline how long you will retain user data, the purposes for which it will be used, and how it will be securely stored and disposed of. Regularly review and update your privacy policy to reflect any changes in data retention practices and communicate these updates to users. Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with your stated data retention practices and address any potential privacy risks promptly.
