To mitigate the vulnerability of not mentioning the categories of personal data collected in the privacy policy, ensure that the policy clearly outlines the specific types of personal data being collected, such as contact information, payment details, browsing history, etc. This transparency helps to build trust with users and demonstrates a commitment to protecting their privacy. Regularly review and update the privacy policy to accurately reflect any changes in data collection practices.
