To mitigate the vulnerability of mismatched data type declarations in the privacy policy, it is important to regularly review and update the policy to ensure that it accurately reflects the actual usage of user account information. This can be done by conducting regular audits of data handling practices and making any necessary adjustments to the policy to align with current practices. Additionally, providing clear and transparent communication with users about how their information is being used can help to build trust and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
