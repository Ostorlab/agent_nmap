To address the requirement of declaring a Privacy manifest file (PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy) for your iOS app and its third-party SDKs, you need to create and configure this file to detail the types of data your app collects, the reason for collecting this data, and the specific APIs that require these declarations. This step is crucial for ensuring your app's compliance with privacy guidelines, enhancing transparency, and building trust with your users.

Here's an overview of the steps and an example to guide you in setting up the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file:

### Step 1: Create the Privacy Manifest File
1. Choose File > New File
2. Scroll down to the Resource section, and select App Privacy File type.
3. Click Next.
4. Check your app or third-party SDK's target in the Targets list.
5. Click Create.

### Step 2: Add Entries for Required APIs
Inside your PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file, you will need to add key-value pairs that represent the APIs your app or its third-party SDKs use, along with the reasons for their use. The keys should be the names of the APIs, and the values should be strings that describe the purpose of using these APIs in your app.

Here's an example structure of what your PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy might look like. This example assumes the use of "File timestamp APIs" and "User defaults APIs":
=== "XML"
  ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
      <dict>
          <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes</key>
          <array>
              <dict>
                  <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType</key>
                  <string>NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryDiskSpace</string>
                  <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons</key>
                  <array>
                      <string>E174.1</string>
                  </array>
              </dict>
              <dict>
                  <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType</key>
                  <string>NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults</string>
                  <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons</key>
                  <array>
                      <string>CA92.1</string>
                  </array>
              </dict>
          </array>
      </dict>
    </plist>
  ```

### Step 3: Ensure Accuracy and Compliance
**Reflect App Functionality:** Ensure that the reasons listed accurately reflect how your app uses the data derived from these APIs.
**No Tracking:** Confirm that you do not use the APIs or derived data for tracking purposes unless explicitly declared and necessary for the appâ€™s functionality.
**Review and Update as Needed:** As your app evolves, regularly review and update your PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file to match any new data collection or API usage.

### Step 4: Documentation and Review
Before submission, double-check your app's documentation and in-app disclosures to ensure they are in alignment with the declarations made in your PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file. This coherence is vital for passing App Store Review Guidelines, particularly those related to privacy.

Adhering to these steps will help ensure your application meets the required standards for privacy and data use transparency, facilitating a smoother review process and enhancing user trust.
