HIPAA Access Control Requirements:
In the case of access control, this is a standard element of data security and means that access to electronic protected
health information will be restricted through a login and authentication method. Thus, a login mechanism is used to
secure and control access to information, and only persons who have been granted the required access rights can log into
information systems contain protected data.
