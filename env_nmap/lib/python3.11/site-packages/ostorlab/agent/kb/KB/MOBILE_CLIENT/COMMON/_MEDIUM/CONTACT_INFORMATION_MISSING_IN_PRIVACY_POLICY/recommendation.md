To mitigate the vulnerability of including contact information in your privacy policy, consider using a generic email address or contact form instead of personal contact information. This can help protect your privacy and prevent potential misuse of your contact details. Additionally, regularly review and update your privacy policy to ensure that any contact information included is accurate and up to date.
