To mitigate the vulnerability of mismatched data type declarations in the privacy policy for phone numbers, it is important to regularly review and update the policy to ensure that it accurately reflects how phone numbers are being used and stored. This includes verifying that the data type declaration for phone numbers aligns with the actual practices and systems in place for handling this sensitive information. Additionally, implementing regular audits and training for staff on data privacy best practices can help to prevent any discrepancies between policy and practice.
