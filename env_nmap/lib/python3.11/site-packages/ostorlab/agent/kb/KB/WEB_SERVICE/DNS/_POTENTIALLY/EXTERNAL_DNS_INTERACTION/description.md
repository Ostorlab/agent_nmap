User-controlled parameters have resulted in triggering a server-side DNS request. The ability to control the server side

An attacker may leverage this functionality to send requests to remote systems for denial of service attacks or exploit
potential vulnerabilities remotely. It is also potentially possible to access internal systems protected with
external network filtering.
