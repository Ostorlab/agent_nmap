The "Webview URL injection" vulnerability refers to a type of Input Validation vulnerability where malicious code is injected into a WebView component used in mobile applications to display web content. This vulnerability can have severe real-world implications and impact businesses in several ways, as illustrated by some examples and generalized business impacts below:

### Real-World Examples
- A notable case involved a vulnerability in the TikTok Android app, where attackers could force the app to load an arbitrary URL in the app’s WebView, potentially leading to unauthorized functionality granted to attackers through the WebView's attached JavaScript bridges [source](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/31/vulnerability-in-tiktok-android-app-could-lead-to-one-click-account-hijacking/#:~:text=Attackers%20could%20force%20the%20app,While%20reviewing%20the%20app%E2%80%99s).
- In 2022, IBM Security Trusteer researchers discovered a trend in financial mobile malware targeting Android devices, utilizing the WebView component to perform Web(View) injection attacks. The malware could manipulate a banking website, steal login credentials, credit card numbers, and intercept text entered by the victim, such as usernames and passwords, by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the WebView component[Security Intelligence](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/view-into-webview-attacks-android/).
- Vulnerabilities in Android WebView were found to affect third-party browsers and apps, potentially allowing cross-site scripting (XSS) or other malicious activities, as exemplified by CVE-2020-6506 [Alesandro Ortiz](https://alesandroortiz.com/articles/uxss-android-webview-cve-2020-6506/#:~:text=A%20vulnerability%20in%20WebView%20could,example%20of%20such%20a%20vulnerability).

### Business Impact
- **Information Disclosure**: Injection attacks can lead to data loss, corruption, and disclosure of sensitive information, impacting both individuals and businesses【19†(MDPI)】.
- **Financial Loss**: In the case of financial mobile malware, attackers can change the payee of a transaction initiated by the victim to a fraudster’s account, causing financial loss【12†(Security Intelligence)】.
- **Reputation Damage**: Compromises through such vulnerabilities could tarnish a business's reputation, potentially leading to a loss of customers and revenue.

These cases and impacts underscore the significance of securing mobile applications against WebView URL injection vulnerabilities to protect sensitive data and maintain the trust and safety of users and stakeholders.
