To mitigate the risks associated with anonymous authentication, consider the following:

- Disable anonymous authentication on the server unless it's required.
- Avoid having sensitive files on the exposed server. 
- Avoid giving anonymous users write permissions.
- Monitor and log anonymous users actions.
