An insecure file path provider is a vulnerability in Android apps where a file path is exposed to other apps or users, which could potentially compromise sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to system resources. 

To safeguard your Android app against vulnerabilities stemming from insecure file path providers, consider these recommendations:

* Avoid permissive settings like '.' in external-path declarations.
* Avoid using `root-path`.
* Avoid assigning `/` as the root path
* Use the `<grant-uri-permission>` tag to control access to shared files.
* Prefer using `external-files-path` path type.
* Use specific folders for path attributes:


For instance, here is an example file provider with `external-files-path` tag and specific `Download/` path attribute.

=== "XML"
	```xml
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<paths>
	    <external-files-path
	        name="downloads"
	        path="Download/" />
	</paths>
	```
