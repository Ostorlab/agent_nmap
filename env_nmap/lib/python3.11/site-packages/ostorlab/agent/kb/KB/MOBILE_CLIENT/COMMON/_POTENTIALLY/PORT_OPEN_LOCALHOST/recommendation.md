Before creating a local server for your application, consider the following:

- Avoid exposing sensitive files over the local server.
- Implement some form of authentication and/or authorization.
- Consider alternative implementations rather than using a local server.
- Avoid listening on `0.0.0.0` or `0::0` to prevent other users on the network from accessing the server.
