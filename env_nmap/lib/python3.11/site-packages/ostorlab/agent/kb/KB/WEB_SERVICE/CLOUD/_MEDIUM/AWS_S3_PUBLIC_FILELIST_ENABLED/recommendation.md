To ensure the proper configuration of the AWS S3 bucket:

- Ensure public access is required. If not, restrict access to authorized users only.
- If public access is required, ensure that file listing is required. If not, remove list object permission from all users' access.
- If public access is required, ensure that no sensitive information is stored in the bucket.
