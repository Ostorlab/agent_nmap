The X-Frame-Options HTTP header field indicates a policy that specifies whether the browser should render the
transmitted resource within a frame or an iframe. Servers can declare this policy in the header of their HTTP responses
to prevent clickjacking attacks, which ensures that their content is not embedded into other pages or frames.
