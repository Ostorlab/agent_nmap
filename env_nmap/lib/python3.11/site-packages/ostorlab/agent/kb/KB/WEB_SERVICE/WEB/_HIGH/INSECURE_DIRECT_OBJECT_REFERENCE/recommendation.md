There are multiple ways to prevent Indirect Object Reference vulnerabilities:

1. **Use Indirect Object References:** Instead of exposing direct references to internal objects (such as database IDs), use indirect references or tokens that are mapped to the objects on the server-side. This prevents users from tampering with identifiers directly.

2. **Implement Access Controls:** Apply access controls at both the frontend and backend to enforce restrictions on what data users can access. This includes role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), or any other relevant access control mechanism.

3. **Use Cryptographically-Secure Object References:** If possible, use cryptographic techniques such as HMAC or UUID to generate unpredictable secure object references or tokens.
