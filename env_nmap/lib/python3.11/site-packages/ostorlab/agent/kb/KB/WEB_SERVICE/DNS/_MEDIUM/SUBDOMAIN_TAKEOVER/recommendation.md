Below are recommendations to mitigate the risk of subdomain takeover attacks:

- **Remove vulnerable subdomain:** Remove the DNS record for the reported vulnerable subdomain
- **Regularly audit and monitor subdomains:** Routinely review all subdomains to ensure they are actively used and necessary.
- **Remove unused third-party services:** Eliminate unnecessary third-party services to reduce the risk of subdomain takeover.
- **Choose your service provider wisely:** Avoid providers with a track record of subdomain takeover issues.
