Failure to accurately declare the types of personally identifiable information (PII) collected and used in your privacy policy can lead to potential legal and regulatory issues, as well as erode trust with users who may feel their privacy is not being adequately protected. It is crucial to ensure that the information declared in the policy aligns with the actual data being collected and processed to maintain transparency and compliance.
