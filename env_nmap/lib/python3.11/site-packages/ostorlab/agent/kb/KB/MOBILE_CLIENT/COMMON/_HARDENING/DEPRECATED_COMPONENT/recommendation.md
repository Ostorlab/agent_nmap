To mitigate the risk associated with deprecated components, consider the steps:

1. Identify the deprecated component: Begin by identifying the specific deprecated component being used in your application. This could be a library, framework, language feature, or any other software component.
2. Find an alternative for the deprecated component or a fork of it that is still maintained.
3. Consider paid services that support EoL projects like [HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/)
