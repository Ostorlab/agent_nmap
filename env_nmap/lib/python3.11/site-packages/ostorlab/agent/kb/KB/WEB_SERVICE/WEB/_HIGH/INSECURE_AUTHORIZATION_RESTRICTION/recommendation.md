Organizations should implement proper access controls and enforce strict validation of HTTP requests to mitigate the risk of insecure authorization restriction HTTP vulnerabilities. This involves having robust server-side logic to manage rules over the HTTP methods, headers, query parameters, and paths received.

Here are some recommendations:

  * **Limit HTTP Methods**: Restrict which HTTP methods can access each of your views/resources.
  * **Sanitize Query Parameters**: Sanitize each request's query parameters and ensure only a limited set of parameters can affect the server's logic.
  * **Limit Headers**: Restrict which headers can affect your code. Use strict rules on what header/method combinations can make changes on the server side, and ensure your logic does not rely on header values that can be easily found on the internet (like Google's User-Agent).
  * **Robust Path Parsing**: Implement robust path parsing with strict rules and reject requests that do not conform to your standards.

   ```python
   # allow only GET and POST methods for this route
  @app.route('/limiting_method_usage', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
  def limiting_method_usage():
      if request.method == 'GET':
          return jsonify({"message": "This is a GET request"})
      elif request.method == 'POST':
          data = request.json
          return jsonify({"message": "This is a POST request", "data": data})
   # only use headers you expect
   @app.route('/limiting_header_values')
  def limiting_header_values():
      expected_header = request.headers.get('Expected-Header')
      ### logic depending on the expected header
